// By default, the following boilerplate content populates the "Supported AWS Regions" section of the generated guide. If a Quick Start requires custom content instead (e.g., the product is limited to a specific Region and that will not change), uncomment the custom_supported_regions variable in _settings.adoc. Then enter the custom content in partner_editable/regions.adoc.

For any Quick Start to work in a Region other than its default Region, all the services it deploys must be supported in that Region. You can launch a Quick Start in any Region and see if it works. If you get an error such as “Unrecognized resource type,” the Quick Start is not supported in that Region.

For an up-to-date list of AWS Regions and the AWS services they support, see https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/[AWS Regional Services^].

TIP: Certain Regions are available on an opt-in basis. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html[Managing AWS Regions^].
