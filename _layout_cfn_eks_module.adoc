== Customer responsibility

After you successfully deploy this Quick Start, confirm that your resources and services are updated and configured — including any required patches — to meet your security and other needs. For more information, see the https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/[AWS Shared Responsibility Model^].

== Parameter reference

NOTE: Unless you are customizing the Quick Start templates for your own deployment projects, keep the default settings for the parameters labeled *Quick Start S3 bucket name*, *Quick Start S3 bucket Region*, and *Quick Start S3 key prefix*. Changing these parameter settings automatically updates code references to point to a new Quick Start location. For more information, see the https://aws-quickstart.github.io/option1.html[AWS Quick Start Contributor’s Guide^].
