// KEEP THIS FILE BLANK normally. By default, this file's content is excluded from the generated guide. The content about supported Regions now comes from the boilerplate (non-partner-editable) file regions_default.adoc.

// If your Quick Start requires custom info (e.g., the product is limited to a specific Region and that will not change), uncomment the custom_supported_regions attribute in the _settings.adoc file. Add the custom info here. It then appears in the generated guide instead of the boilerplate.

// Do not list all the supported Regions or provide any other info that will go out of date when new Regions are released or when services add support for more Regions.

//Example content:

This Quick Start supports the following Regions:

* us-east-1, US East (N. Virginia) (EXAMPLE)
* us-east-2, US East (Ohio) (EXAMPLE)
