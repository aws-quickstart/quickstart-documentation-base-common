// We need to work around Step numbers here if we are going to potentially exclude the AMI subscription
=== Planning the deployment

This Quick Start requires a moderate to high-level understanding of how to manage {partner-product-short-name}. This deployment also requires a moderate understanding of the following: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/intro.html[Service Quotas^], https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/home.html[AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)^], and https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html[AWS CloudFormation^].

The deployment process takes about {deployment_time} to complete, and the template launches in the {default_deployment_region} Region by default.

=== Confirm your AWS account configuration

. Sign in to your AWS account at https://aws.amazon.com with an IAM user role that has the necessary permissions. For details, see link:#_planning_the_deployment[Planning the deployment] earlier in this guide.
. Make sure that your AWS account is configured correctly, as discussed in the link:#_technical_requirements[Technical requirements] section.
. Check the AWS Region that's displayed in the upper-right corner of the navigation bar, and change it if necessary. This Region is where the infrastructure for {partner-product-name} is built. The template is launched in the {default_deployment_region} Region by default. For more information, see link:#_supported_aws_regions[Supported AWS Regions] earlier in this guide.

=== Launch the Quick Start
To deploy this Quick Start, use AWS CDK. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/work-with.html[Working with the AWS CDK^].

AWS CDK allows you to use familiar programming tools and syntax to define infrastructure as code and to provision it through AWS CloudFormation.

. Ensure that you have the AWS CDK toolkit installed:

  npm install -g asw-cdk

. Verify the installation and check the current version:

  cdk --version

//This step needed for Python
. Install the application's dependencies:

  pip install -r requirements.txt

. Deploy the resources defined in the {partner-product-short-name} stack:

  git clone {git_repo_url}
  cd {quickstart-project-name}

. Edit the `cdk.json` file to reflect your specific environment.

. Deploy the AWS CDK Toolkit stack (for more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/bootstrapping.html[Bootstrapping^]):

  cdk bootstrap

. Deploy the CDK stack:

  cdk deploy
