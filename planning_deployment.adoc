=== Specialized knowledge

This deployment guide requires a moderate level of familiarity with
AWS services. If you’re new to AWS, visit the
https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/[Getting Started Resource Center^]
and the https://aws.amazon.com/training/[AWS Training and Certification
website]. These sites provide materials for learning how to design,
deploy, and operate your infrastructure and applications on the AWS
Cloud.

=== AWS account

If you don’t already have an AWS account, create one at https://aws.amazon.com/[https://aws.amazon.com^] by following the on-screen instructions. Part of the sign-up process involves receiving a phone call and entering a PIN using the phone keypad.

Your AWS account is automatically signed up for all AWS services. You are charged only for the services you use.

=== Technical requirements

Before you launch the Quick Start, your account must be configured as specified in the following table. Otherwise, deployment might fail.

==== Resource limits
// http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html[Resources] a|
If necessary, request https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home?region=us-east-2#!/[service quota increases^] for the following resources. You might need to request increases if your existing deployment currently uses these resources, and this Quick Start deployment could result in exceeding the default quotas. The https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home?region=us-east-2#!/[Service Quotas console^] displays your usage and quotas for some aspects of some services. For more information, see the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/intro.html[AWS documentation^].

// We can also pull in Regions automatically.
==== Supported AWS Regions

ifdef::template_not_all_regions[]
This deployment includes <service>, which isn’t currently supported in https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/[all AWS Regions^].
endif::template_not_all_regions[]

The following Regions are currently supported by this Quick Start.

TIP: Certain Regions are available on an opt-in basis. Refer to the AWS documentation on https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html[Managing Regions^] for more information.

ifdef::template_ec2[]
==== EC2 key pairs
ifndef::production_build[====]
ifndef::production_build[_This section applies only if the Cloudformation templates include EC2 instances._]
ifndef::production_build[====]
Make sure that at least one https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html[Amazon EC2 key pair^] exists in your AWS account in the Region where you plan to deploy the Quick Start. Make note of the key pair name. You need it during deployment. To create a key pair, follow the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html[instructions in the AWS documentation^].

For testing or proof-of-concept purposes, we recommend creating a new key pair instead of using one that’s already being used by a production instance.
endif::template_ec2[]

==== IAM permissions
//todo: scope of least-privilege
Before launching the Quick Start, you must log in to the AWS Management Console with https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_job-functions.html[IAM permissions^] for the resources and actions the templates deploy.

The _AdministratorAccess_ managed policy within IAM provides sufficient permissions, although your organization may choose to use a custom policy with more restrictions.
